Los principales beneficios de usar SSR es que facilita el posicionamiento SEO y reduce el tiempo de carga inicial de la página.\n\n\n\nTarea\nDescripción\n\n\n\n\ntsc:server\nEs el que compila el servidor Express siguiendo la configuración anterior.\n\n\nbuild:client-and-server-bundles\nEs el comando que compila tu app Angular para producción y usando AOT, tanto la versión de navegador como la versión de servidor.\n\n\nbuild:universal\nEs un comando útil que se encarga de llamar a los dos comandos anteriores.

While the simplicity behind these frameworks can\ndefinitely be attractive, they lack in my opinion what is essential when making big, enterprise-grade apps: a solid\nframe to lead both experienced developers and beginners in the same direction and a rational convergence of tools,\npatterns and documentation. Yes, the Angular learning curve may seems a little steep, but it’s definitely worth it.\nGetting started\nNewcomer\nIf you're new to Angular you may feel overwhelmed by the quantity of new concepts to apprehend, so before digging in\nthis project you may want to start with this progressive tutorial that will guide you\nstep by step into building a complete Angular application.\nAngularJS veteran\nIf you come from AngularJS and want to dig straight in the new version, you may want to take a look at the\nAngularJS vs 2 quick reference.\nCheatsheet\nUntil you know the full Angular API by heart, you may want to keep this\ncheatsheet that resumes the syntax and features on a single page at hand.\nStyle guide\nThis project follows the standard Angular style guide.\nMore that just coding rules, this style guide also gives advices and best practices for a good application architecture\nand is an essential reading for starters. Reading deeper, you can even find many explanations for some design\nchoices of the framework.\nGoing deeper\nEven though they are not mandatory, Angular was designed for the use of design patterns you may not be accustomed to,\nlike reactive programming, unidirectional data flow and\ncentralized state management.\nThese concepts are difficult to resume in a few words, and despite being tightly related to each other they concern\nspecific parts of an application flow, each being quite deep to learn on its own.\nYou will essentially find here a list of good starting points to learn more on these subjects. \nReactive programming\nYou may not be aware of it, but Angular is now a reactive system by design.\nAlthough you are not forced to use reactive programming patterns, they make the core of the framework and it is\ndefinitely recommended to learn them if you want to leverage the best of Angular.\nAngular uses RxJS to implement the Observable pattern.\n\nAn Observable is a stream of asynchronous events that can be processed with array-like operators.\n\nFrom promises to observables\nWhile AngularJS used to rely heavily on Promises to handle\nasynchronous events, Observables are now used instead in Angular. Even though in specific cases like for HTTP\nrequests, an Observable can be converted into a Promise, it is recommended to embrace the new paradigm as it can a\nlot more than Promises, with way less code. This transition is also explained in the \nAngular tutorial.\nOnce you have made the switch, you will never look back again.\nLearning references\n\nWhat is reactive programming?, explained nicely through a simple\nimaged story (5 min)\n\nThe introduction to reactive programming you've been missing,\nthe title says it all (30 min)\n\nFunctional reactive programming for Angular 2 developers,\nsee the functional reactive programming principles in practice with Angular (15 min)\n\nRxMarbles, a graphical representation of Rx operators that greatly help to understand their\nusage\n\n\nUnidirectional data flow\nIn opposition with AngularJS where one of its selling points was two-way data binding which ended up causing a lot of\nmajor headaches for complex applications, Angular now enforces unidirectional data flow.\nWhat does it means? Said with other words, it means that change detection cannot cause cycles, which was one of\nAngularJS problematic points. It also helps to maintain simpler and more predictable data flows in applications, along\nwith substantial performance improvements.\nWait, then why the Angular documentation have mention of a\ntwo-way binding syntax?\nIf you look closely, the new two-way binding syntax is just syntactic sugar to combine two one-way bindings (a\nproperty and event binding), keeping the data flow unidirectional.\nThis change is really important, as it was often the cause of performance issues with AngularJS, and it one of the\npillars enabling better performance in new Angular apps.\nWhile Angular tries to stay pattern-agnostic and can be used with conventional MV* patterns, it was designed with\nreactive programming in mind and really shines when used with reactive data flow patterns like\nredux,\nFlux or\nMVI.\nCentralized state management\nAs applications grow in size, keeping track of the all its individual components state and data flows can become\ntedious, and tend to be difficult to manage and debug.\nThe main goal of using a centralized state management is to make state changes predictable by imposing certain\nrestrictions on how and when updates can happen, using unidirectional data flow.\nThis approach was first made popular with React with introduction of the\nFlux architecture. Many libraries emerged then\ntrying to adapt and refine the original concept, and one of these gained massive popularity by providing a simpler,\nelegant alternative: Redux.\nRedux is at the same time a library (with the big R) and a design pattern (with the little r), the latter being\nframework-agnostic and working very well with Angular.\nThe redux design pattern is based on these 3 principles:\n\nThe application state is a single immutable data structure\nA state change is triggered by an action, an object describing what happened\nPure functions called reducers take the previous state and the next action to compute the new state\n\nThe core concepts behind these principles are nicely explained in\nthis example (3 min).\nWhich library to use?\nYou can make Angular work with any state management library you like, but your best bet would be to use\n@ngrx/store. It works the same as the popular Redux library,\nbut with a tight integration with Angular and RxJS, with some nice additional developer\nutilities.\nHere are some resources to get started:\n\nBuild a better Angular 2 application with redux and ngrx,\na nice tutorial for @ngrx/store (30 min)\n\nComprehensive introduction to @ngrx/store, an in-depth\nwalkthrough to this library usage in Angular (60 min)\n\n\nWhen to use it?\nYou may have noticed that the starter template does not include a centralized state management system out of the box.\nWhy is that? Well, while there is many benefits from using this pattern, the choice is ultimately up to your team and\nwhat you want to achieve with your app.\nKeep in mind that using a single centralized state for your app introduces a new layer a complexity\nthat might not be needed, depending of your\ngoal.\nOptimizing performance\nWhile the new Angular version resolves by design most of the performance issues that could be experienced with\nAngularJS, there is always room for improvements. Just keep in mind that delivering an app with good performance is\noften a matter of common sense and sane development practices.\nHere is a list of key points to check for in your app to\nmake sure you deliver the best experience to your customers.\nAfter going through the checklist, make sure to also run an audit of your page through\nLighthouse, the latest Google tool that gives you meaningful\ninsight about your app performance, accessibility, mobile compatibility and more.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/coding-guides/e2e-tests.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/coding-guides/e2e-tests.html","title":"additional-page -

The nesting approach has drawbacks such as increased specificity, but it helps\n  keeping everything nicely organized, and more importantly, scoped.\n\n\n\nAlso keep in mind this general rules:\n\nAlways use class selectors, never use ID selectors and avoid element selectors whenever possible\nNo more than 3 levels of nesting\nNo more than 3 qualifiers\n\nBest practices\n\nUse object-oriented CSS (OOCSS):\n\nFactorize common code in base class, and extend it, for example:\n`scss\n// Base button class\n.btn { ... }\n\n// Color variation\n.btn-warning { ... }\n// Size variation\n.btn-small { ... }\n`\n\nTry to name class by semantic, not style nor function for better reusability:\nUse .btn-warning, not btn-orange nor btn-cancel\nAvoid undoing style, refactor using common base classes and extensions\n\n\nKeep your style scoped\n\nClearly separate global (think framework) and components style\nGlobal style should only go in src/theme/, never in components\nAvoid style interactions between components, if some style may need to be shared, refactor it as a framework\ncomponent in put it in your global theme.\nAvoid using wider selectors than needed: always use classes if you can!\n\n\nAvoid rules multiplication\n\nThe less CSS the better, factorize rules whenever it's possible\nCSS is code, and like any code frequent refactoring is healthy\n\n\nWhen ugly hacks cannot be avoided, create an explicit src/hacks.scss file and put it in:\n\nThese ugly hacks should only be temporary\nEach hack should be documented with the author name, the problem and hack reason\nLimit this file to a reasonable length (~100 lines) and refactor hacks with proper solutions when the limit is \nreached.\n\n\n\nPitfalls\n\nNever use the !important keyword. Ever.\nNever use inline style in html, even just for debugging (because we KNOW it will end up in your commit)\n\nBrowser compatibility\nYou should never use browser-specific prefixes in your code, as autoprefixer\ntakes care of that part for you during the build process.\nYou just need to declare which browsers you target in the browserslist file.\nEnforcement\nCoding rules are enforced in this project with stylelint.\nThis tool also checks the compatibility of the rules used against the browsers you are targeting (specified in the\nbrowserslist file), via doiuse.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/coding-guides/typescript.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/coding-guides/typescript.html","title":"additional-page - Typescript","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript coding guide\nTypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that greatly helps building large web\napplications.\nCoding conventions and best practices comes from the\nTypeScript guidelines, and are also detailed in the\nTypeScript Deep Dive Style Guide.\nIn addition, this project also follows the general Angular style guide.\nNaming conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for types, classes, interfaces, constants and enum values.\nUse camelCase for variables, properties and functions\nAvoid prefixing interfaces with a capital I, see Angular style guide\nDo not use _ as a prefix for private properties.

But if you need priorities, at least all business logic code must be tested: services, helpers, models...\nShared directives/components should also be covered by unit tests, if you do not have the time to test every single\ncomponent.\nKeep in mind that component unit tests should not overlap with end-to-end tests: while unit the tests\ncover the isolated behavior of the component bindings and methods, the end-to-end tests in opposition should cover the\nintegration and interactions with other app components based on real use cases scenarios.\nGood practices\n\nName your tests cleanly and consistently\nDo not only test nominal cases, the most important tests are the one covering the edge cases\nEach test should be independent to all the others\nAvoid unnecessary assertions: it's counter-productive to assert anything covered by another test, it just increase\npointless failures and maintenance workload\nTest only one code unit at a time: if you cannot do this, it means you have an architecture problem in your app\nMock out all external dependencies and state: if there is too much to mock, it is often a sign that maybe you\nshould split your tested module into several more independent modules\nClearly separate or identify these 3 stages of each unit test (the 3A): arrange, act and assert\nWhen you fix a bug, add a test case for it to prevent regression\n\nPitfalls\n\nSometimes your architecture might mean your code modify static variables during unit tests. Avoid this if you can, \nbut if you can't, at least make sure each test resets the relevant statics before and after your tests.\nDon’t unit-test configuration settings\nImproving test coverage is good, but having meaningful tests is better: start with the latter first, and only after\nessential features of your code unit are tested, your can think of improving the coverage.\n\nUnit testing with Angular\nA good starting point for learning is the official\ntesting guide.\nBut as you will most likely want to go bit further in real world apps, these\nexample test snippets are also very helpful to\nlearn how to cover most common testing use cases.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/coding-guides/angular-doc.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/coding-guides/angular-doc.html","title":"additional-page -
